L2 MIASHS PROJECT
## Introduction
We worked as a part-time team of five on a pedagogical project. Its objective was to provide first-year MIASHS students with an opportunity to practice the various concepts they had learned during the semester in a fun and engaging manner. It served as a means for them to assess their proficiency levels, as they progressed through different levels where the concepts became increasingly complex and specific.
